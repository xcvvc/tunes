#tunes project

Collection of scripts to make a small mp3 collection, dvd, or cd from the large iTunes archive on the local iMac.

This all depends on using an older iMac that still has iTunes and the following file containing all the data:

lg -> Music -> iTunes -> "iTunes Music Library.xml"

While the .xml is on the iMac local drive, the .mp3 files are on an external hdd, which is a precaution when copying the files from source to destination.

movemp3.plx
    creates a shell script to review before the actual copy.


artistonlylist.plx
    creates a list of names.
